# Advertising and sales prediction using linear regression
This project analyzes the relationship between advertising spending and product sales using linear regression.
Using the data acquired on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset/data, we aim to predict sales using advertising spending.
Various techniques are used such as exploratory data analysis, multiple linear regression, feature selection, residual analysis, model refinement.
The final result is a simplified model using TV and Radio which achieved a strong RÂ² of 0.908 with low prediction error.
